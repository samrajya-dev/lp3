<pre><code>
	<b>What are Smart Contracts?</b>

	Solidityâ€™s code is encapsulated in contracts which means a contract in Solidity is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) 
	that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. A contract is a fundamental block of building an application on Ethereum. 

	Implementation
	Step 1: Open <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Remix IDE.</a>
	Step 2: Click on File Explorers and select Solidity in the environment and create a new file <b>StudentData.sol</b> by clicking on New File section.
	Step 3: Build a smart contract that contains all the details of the student with the help of Remix IDE by clicking on the file name.


			// SPDX-Licence-Identifier: GPL-3.0
			pragma solidity ^0.8.1;

			// Build the Contract
			contract MarksManagmtSys
			{
				// Create a structure for
				// student details
				struct Student
				{
					int ID;
					string fName;
					string lName;
					int marks;
				}

				address owner;
				int public stdCount = 0;
				mapping(int => Student) public stdRecords;

				modifier onlyOwner
				{
					require(owner == msg.sender);
					_;
				}
				constructor()
				{
					owner=msg.sender;
				}

				// Create a function to add
				// the new records
				function addNewRecords(int _ID, string memory _fName, string memory _lName, int _marks) 

				public onlyOwner
				{
					// Increase the count by 1
					stdCount = stdCount + 1;

					// Fetch the student details
					// with the help of stdCount
					stdRecords[stdCount] = Student(_ID, _fName, _lName, _marks);
				}

				// Create a function to add bonus marks
				function bonusMarks(int _bonus) public onlyOwner
				{
					stdRecords[stdCount].marks =
								stdRecords[stdCount].marks + _bonus;
				}
			}






	Step 4: After building the contract compile it.
	Step 5: After successful compilation, to deploy the contract click on the Deploy button.
	Step 6: If the contract is successfully deployed then deployed contract is obtained. Open the deployed contract and add the student details and transact it.
