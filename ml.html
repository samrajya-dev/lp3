Predict the price of the Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off location.<br>
Perform following tasks:<br>
1. Pre-process the dataset.<br>
2. Identify outliers.<br>
3. Check the correlation.<br>
4. Implement linear regression and random forest regression models.<br>
5. Evaluate the models and compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

Classify the email using the binary classification method. Email Spam detection has two
states: <br>a) Normal State – Not Spam <br>b) Abnormal State – Spam.<br> Use K-Nearest Neighbors and
Support Vector Machine for classification. Analyze their performance.

Given a bank customer, build a neural network-based classifier that can determine whether they will leave or not in the next 6 months.<br>
Dataset Description: The case study is from an open-source dataset from Kaggle.<br>
The dataset contains 10,000 sample points with 14 distinct features such as<br>
CustomerId, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, etc.<br>
Link to the Kaggle project:<br>
https://www.kaggle.com/barelydedicated/bank-customer-churn-modeling<br>
Perform following steps:<br>
1. Read the dataset.<br>
2. Distinguish the feature and target set and divide the data set into training and test sets.<br>
3. Normalize the train and test data.<br>
4. Initialize and build the model. Identify the points of improvement and implement the same.<br>
5. Print the accuracy score and confusion matrix (5 points).<br>
