	Implementation
	
	<b>Step 1:Install MetaMask on your browser.</b>
	To create a new wallet, you have to install the extension first. Depending on your browser, there are different marketplaces to find it. 
	Most browsers have MetaMask on their stores, so it’s not that hard to see it, but either way, here they are Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.
		Click on Install MetaMask as a Google Chrome extension.
		Click Add to Chrome.
		Click Add Extension.

	<b>Step 2. Create an account.</b>

		1. Click on the extension icon in the upper right corner to open MetaMask.
		2. To install the latest version and be up to date, click Try it now Click Continue.
		3. You will be prompted to create a new password. Click Create.
		4. Proceed by clicking Next and accept the Terms of Use.
	
		Click Reveal Secret Words. There you will see a 12 words seed phrase. This is really important and usually not a good idea to store digitally, so take your time and write it down.
		
		5. Verify your secret phrase by selecting the previously generated phrase in order. Click Confirm.
	
	And that’s it; now you have created your MetaMask account successfully. A new Ethereum wallet address has just been created for you. It’s waiting for you to deposit funds, and if you want to learn how to do that, look at the next step below.
