			3. Write a smart contract on a test network, for Bank account of a customer for following operations:<br>
			Deposit money<br>
			Withdraw Money<br>
			Show balance
	</b>
</div>


<pre><code>

	Implementation
	Step 1: Open <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Remix IDE.</a>
	Step 2: Click on File Explorers and select Solidity in the environment and create a new file <b>bank.sol</b> by clicking on New File section.
	Step 3: Build a smart contract that contains all the details of the student with the help of Remix IDE by clicking on the file name.


		//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT 

		pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

		//i created a smart contract that allows a user to deposit, withdraw and save ETH!!

		contract SmartSHop{
		    //we mapped the address of the caller balance in the contract
		    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

		// whatever the user deposit is added to msg.value of the sender address we mapped above
		    function deposit() public payable{
		        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value; 
		    }
		    
		//we create the fucntion of witdraw 
		    function withdraw(uint _amount) public{
		        //we create a require arg to make sure the balance of the sender is >= _amount if not ERR
		        require(balances[msg.sender]>= _amount, "Not enough ether");
		        //if the amount is availabe we subtract it from the sender 
		        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
		        //True bool is called to confirm the amount
		        (bool sent,) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("Sent");
		        require(sent, "failed to send ETH");

		        
		    }

		    function getBal() public view returns(uint){
		        return address(this).balance;
		    }




		}






	Step 4: After building the contract compile it.
	Step 5: After successful compilation, to deploy the contract click on the Deploy button.
	Step 6: If the contract is successfully deployed then deployed contract is obtained. Open the deployed contract and add the student details and transact it.
